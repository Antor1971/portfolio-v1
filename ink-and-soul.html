About 518 years ago in Planet X09 there lived a boy named Willy. He lived with his parents and sister. They lived in a kingdom named Zorax. Willy was a simple boy with some imaginary dreams. Willy was a homesick boy. He used to play with his sister named Rozai. Willy was her elder brother. At that time people of X09 had developed so much that they were using the technologies that we are using in the current time. Willy's parents used to work in the nearby farm. Willy used to lead a very simple life. But in the kingdom Zorax everything was not going properly. The Zorax kingdom by a selfish ruler named Woose. Before Woose it was ruled by Kore his character was also same as Woose. There were strikes everyday in the kingdom given by the Kore and team. The people were not happy with these. They wanted peace and their rights back. Anyway Willy's life was going good. He started going to school. He had made some friends. He was not homesick anymore. Willy had dreams to become something great in future. Willy had seen the sufferings of the people of Zorax. People were killed everyday by the people of Kore. Kore wanted the kingdom back. But Woose also had a plan to show the people that Kore is a bad guy, Woose is the one who is protecting them. Meanwhile Willy's parents decided to take Willy and Rozai to a picnic. The next day they had started for the picnic. They were going to the picnic by bus. The bus had started. But Willy and his family didn't know that there was a bomb in the bus. It was given by the army of Woose. It was his plan. Willy and Rozai were very happy. It was Willy's first picnic. He was very excited. The bomb's countdown started. After one minute it was going to blast. They didn't know anything about this. 00:00, 00:00:09, 0:00:08,… 00:00:02, 0:00:01. 0:00:00. BOOM!!! Everything was finished. Willy's dreams were finished too. By this incident Woose was very happy. But there remain some questions, what was Willy's fault? What he had done wrong to Woose and Kore?

[Note: This story has been written on the reality of our current political conditions. Around us there are many people like Woose and Kore. They think that we are their puppets. The time has come. Now we all should stand against them.]</p>

Money is the biggest X-factor,<br>
You need this in each &amp; every sector.<br><br>
When the money you have,<br>
You got thousands of friends to grab.<br><br>
Lack of this will show the real view,<br>
You will see a world totally new.<br><br>
People with friend's mask will come out,<br>
You can't do anything with that holy shout.<br><br>
In 2019 if you don't have the money,<br>
'SORRY dear you won't get your honey.<br><br>
Identify the real sight,<br>
Hold up your gun to fight .
